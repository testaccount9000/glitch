# Glitch Community Projects

Discover new reasons to code, remix cool and helpful projects made with Glitch.

Philosophically, a little bit `Youtube`, some `Spotify`, with a sprinkle of `app store`.

Getting Started
-----------------

File structure


- the backend app starts at `server.js`
- `src/client.js` is compiled and served as /client-bundle.js
- view templates are powered by the .jade files in `src/templates/`. A conversion from Jadelet to React.js is underway-- new files are .jsx :-)
- stylus files like `public/styles/style.styl` is compiled and served directly as `public/style.css`
- Files in `public/` are served directly
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

application models -> presenter -> DOM

#### Remixing this project

Once you remix this project, it'll come straight to life! The only external dependency that doesn't remix cleanly is OAuth login -- see the [FAQ](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/community?path=FAQ.md) for a workaround.
