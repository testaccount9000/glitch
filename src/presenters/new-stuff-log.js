Tidy up your profile page without fear of regret.
There's a new "Delete This" button on your project tiles that'll let you clean up 
your old experiments and help you present a healthier, more active looking profile page. ü•¶

All of your deleted projects are listed for you at the bottom of your profile page,
and you can restore them to life with just one click.
