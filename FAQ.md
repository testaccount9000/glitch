### I remixed this site... how do I log in?

There's a peculiarity around Oauth logins, since the providers expect the site to have a different domain than what your remix has.  To log in to your new remixed site:

1. In a new browser tab, visit [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com) and log in if you aren't already.

2. Open up your browser's [Developer Tools](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/77337/2628) and run this command in the console: `window.localStorage.cachedUser`.  Highlight and copy the big JSON blob that it prints out.
  
3. Now, back in your remixed community site, click on the 'show' button to view your running app.  Open the developer tools again and this time type in
  
  ```
  window.localStorage.cachedUser = `[Paste Here]`
  ```
  
replacing the `[Paste Here]` with your copied JSON blob from the other tab. Hit enter, refresh the page, and you're logged in! 

Depending on what browser you're using, there might be a finnicky spacing issue that's preventing the JSON from coming through cleanly.  If that's the case, it can be helpful to copy just the inner JSON object, and then load the object into the page using 
```
window.localStorage.cachedUser = JSON.stringify(`[Paste JSON Here]`)
```


### Why are some templates in .jade, and others in .jsx?

This site started as a Jadelet site, so all the templates were written in .jade.  We're in the process of converting it to a React.js site, so for now we see a mixture of .jsx and .jade files.  Eventually we'll be 100% .jsx and 0% .jade, but we're working toward that incrementally.

All new content should be in .jsx,  and we're capable of calling .jsx templates from within .jade templates.  We're not presently able to call .jade templates from within .jsx, but we solve that by porting the pages to .jsx instead.


### How do I add a question to the FAQ?

I'd suggest remixing the site and adding the question.  Feel free to take a stab at the answer, if you like.  See CONTRIBUTING.md for how to contribute :-)
